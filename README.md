My cross-platform `vim`, `bash` and `mintty` dotfiles.

Should work on the following platform without any changes:

* OS X
* Linux
* Cygwin
* Windows (vim only)

The `vim` config is [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) based.

vim notes
---------

Requires *Vim 7.3.885+* with Lua enabled for
(neocomplete)[https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim] to work (see the
(project page)[https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim] for details).
Alternatively, you can use
(neocomplcache)[https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache.vim] with vanilla
vim (much slower), or disable `neocomplete` altogether.
