Description
-----------

My cross-platform **vim**, **bash** and **mintty** dotfiles.

Should work on the following platforms without any changes:

* OS X
* Linux
* Cygwin
* Windows (Vim only)

Vim notes
---------

The Vim config is [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) based.

Requires **Vim 7.3.885+** with **Lua enabled** for
[neocomplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim) to work (see the
[project page](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim) for details).
Alternatively, you can use
[neocomplcache](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache.vim) with vanilla
Vim (much slower), or disable neocomplete altogether in `vimrc`.
